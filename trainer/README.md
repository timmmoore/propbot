# Spin2 Weight Trainer

Copied and modified from https://github.com/JonComo/Arduino_weight_trainer

Made for this project https://github.com/timmoore/propbot

I use Visual Studio Code to run it with Jupyter extension

Increased number of epochs, decrease precision of weights generated

You'll need the following packages (you can pip install each of them)

tensorflow

keras

numpy

jupyter notebook

matplotlib

To use:

Setup x_train and y_train in the notebook to be the examples you want the network to train on.

Run the cells sequentially and you'll see your network fit the training data.

The final cell prints out a nicely formatted text version of the trained weights that you can copy directly into your spin2 file!
